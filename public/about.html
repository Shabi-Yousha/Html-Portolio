<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello, I am Shabi Abdallah Yousha and I am delighted to present a glimpse into my world, 
  a world shaped by a deep-rooted passion for environmental science,community service, 
  and the joy of connecting with nature.From my early childhood, my uncle would take me to the zoo 
  and the forest sometimes just to appreciate nature and wildlife. Sometimes he'd show me some medicinal 
  plants and their actual functions, this gradually increased my passion for environmental conservation. 
</p>

<p>In high school, I was fortunate to be elected as President of the Prempeh Sustainability Club. 
  During my tenure, we undertook a remarkable initiative to plant 500 trees on our campus, 
  contributing to the preservation of our school’s local environment. 
  After graduating, I co-founded Yanani, a youth-led program dedicated to combating climate change 
  and fostering a profound connection between people and nature. 
  Through Yanani, I led environmental awareness workshops in over 40 high schools, enlightening young minds 
  about the urgency of environmental conservation. We also organized 10+ funded hikes to iconic destinations 
  like the Mole National Park and Atewa Forest Reserve in order to create unforgettable experiences that reinforced 
  the importance of preserving our natural heritage.</p>

<p>I am also an avid participant of community service activities. 
  I have had the chance to fundraise, serve, and prepare food for children 
  and adults with mental and physical disabilities at the Kanda Islamic Foundation. 
  I also partnered with CEED, an environmental protection agency to mark some 
  trees as “uncuttable” provided they weren’t causing any obstruction, 
  and further named them scientifically and informally, with some trivia posted on 
  them to educate people about their importance.</p>
  
<p>In my leisure, I find peace in drawing because it allows me to channel my creativity. 
    Even though I only paint in my leisure time, I was fortunate enough to win the 
    outstanding student project for my drawing in the GYEM High School Challenge. 
    In the same competition, I also won the Outstanding Student Project for building a prototype
    of an electronic soil moisture sensor to help conserve water and reduce waste.</p>
  
<p>I also enjoy capturing the beauty of life through photography. 
  Whether it’s pictures of random individuals( with their consent of course), 
  snapshots of plants or candid shots of family and friends, my camera sometimes 
  becomes a tool for preserving moments and celebrating the richness of the world around me. </p>

<p>Additionally, I typically dedicate my weekends to accompanying my younger brother to the 
    park where I take joy in watching him play soccer, an incredible soccer player he is! 
    This might sound cliche but I like to read too. In 2023 alone, I have read 10 books 
    including but not limited to ‘Born a crime’, ‘Gifted Hands’, ‘Pride’ and ‘Prejudice’, 
    ‘Persuasion’, ‘Deep work’, and ‘So good they can’t ignore you’ with my most 
    recent being ‘The Laws of Human Nature’</p>
<p>I am excited about the prospect of becoming a part of your academic community, 
   where I can continue to learn, grow, and contribute to the betterment of our world.</p>
